# SOLID Priciples

S : Single Responsiblity : A class should have one and only one reason to change.
O : Open/Close Priciple : Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
L : Liskov Substitution : Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
I : Interface Segregation Principle : Interfaces should be specific to the needs of clients, not generalized.
D : Dependecy Inversion Principle : Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.
