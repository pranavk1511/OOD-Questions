# OOD ( Object oriented design )

- Key pillars in OOD

1. Classes and Objects  ( achived in Python using class and methods in it , you can call the class via an object )
2. Encapsulation  ( private and public only , cannot implement protected , does name mangling for Private valriables to prevent access)
3. Inheritance ( declare the class () and you can call multiple classes )
4. Polymorhism ( method overloading is not allowed in python , you will overload and print the recent function , you can do overring  similar to abstract class )
5. Abstaction  ( from abc import ABC and abstract class , your parent should call the ABC class)
